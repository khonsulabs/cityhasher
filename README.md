A pure Rust implementation of [CityHash](https://github.com/google/cityhash), a
hashing algorithm developed at Google by Geoff Pike and Jyrki Alakuijala that
has impressive performance and hashing quality.

This crate implements the current version of CityHash (v1.1) for 32- and 64-bit
outputs. If any of the remaining functionality is desired, please [open an
issue](https://github.com/khonsulabs/cityhasher).

This crate was implemented by directly porting the C++ reference implementation.
The test suite from the C++ codebase was also ported, and this implementation
passes the test suite. The goal of this crate is to provide a pure Rust
implementation that produces idential output as the C++ reference
implementation.

## Why use CityHash?

Before considering why to use CityHash, the primary reason to avoid CityHash is
if you need a hashing algorithm that is suitable for cryptography. Otherwise,
from [Google's announcement][ann]:

> We were greatly inspired by previous work on hashing, especially Austin
> Applebyâ€™s MurmurHash. The key advantage of our approach is that most steps
> contain at least two independent mathematical operations. Modern CPUs tend to
> perform best with this type of code.
>
> The disadvantage of our approach is that the code is more complicated than
> most popular alternatives. We decided to optimize for speed rather than
> simplicity and even included special cases for short inputs.

## no_std support

This crate supports `no_std` environments when the `std` feature is not enabled.
Because this feature is enabled by default, add the crate without default
features to ensure no_std compatibility:

```toml
cityhasher = { version = "*", default-features = false }
```

## Feature Flags

- `std`: Enables type aliases for `HashMap` and `HashSet`. Enabled by default.
- `disable-bounds-checking`: When this flag is enabled, the crate utilizes
  unsafe code to access the data being hashed without bounds checking. This
  crate utilizes no other unsafe code. Enabled by default.

## Using HashMap/HashSet with this crate

This crate exports type aliases making it easy to use the standard library
collection types:

```rust
let mut map = cityhasher::HashMap::new();
map.insert(1, "hello");
map.insert(2, "world");
assert_eq!(map.get(&1), Some(&"hello"));

let mut set = cityhasher::HashSet::new();
set.insert(1);
set.insert(2);
assert!(set.contains(&1));
```

These type aliases are included if the `std` feature is enabled.

## Hashing bytes with this crate

This crate provides two functions to hash data: [`hash`] and [`hash_with_seed`].
Both functions use a generic parameter to control the hashing algorithm. If you
need to be compatible with other implementations of CityHash, ensure that you
are using the same size unsigned type in Rust as the desired output size.

The original CityHash library does not provide a [`hash_with_seed`] compatible
implementation for 32-bit hashes.

```rust
let hash32: u32 = cityhasher::hash("hello");
let hash64: u64 = cityhasher::hash("hello");let bytes =
assert_ne!(hash32 as u64, hash64);

let hash64_seeded: u64 = cityhasher::hash_with_seed("hello", 1);
assert_ne!(hash64_seeded, hash64);
```

## Benchmarks

This crate performs nearly identically as the original C++ implementation when
benchmarked on the developers machine using:

```sh
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo +nightly bench -p benchmarks --features unsafe,nightly
```

This crate does not require nightly, but `cityhash-sys` currently does (v1.0.5).

### 32-bit hashing

This benchmark measures how long it takes to produce 32-bit hash values of
inputs of varying byte lengths. The other crates compared against are
[cityhash-sys](https://github.com/HUD-Software/cityhash-sys) and
[crc32fast](https://github.com/srijs/rust-crc32fast):
